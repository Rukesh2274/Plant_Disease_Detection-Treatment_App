# Plant_Disease_Detection-Treatment_App

1. Overview : 

The detection and treating the disease in plants and crops helps in maintain the crops and fruits healthy by preventing the insects and diseases that spoils the crop. Plant diseases is important as they cause loss to the plant as well as plant production.The traditional methods mainly used by specialists, experience, and manuals, but the majority of them are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive with difficulty detecting precisely. This detecting and treating the disease in plants and crops increases a rapid and accurate approach to detect the plant/crop diseases seems so urgent for the benefit of business and ecology to agriculture. 

2. Motivation for the project : 

Mostly farmers use the traditional method for spraying and using the fertilizers and pesticides to the diseases and pests, without proper knowledge of the disease about plant or a crop. By using the pesticides will harm the crop as well as fruits. If the unknown disease is detected the image with problem is posted to community then the agriculture experts or well-known farmers can give solution to it. The main motivation is about to identify the plant and crop diseases using CNN image processing. It also, after identification of the disease and suggest the name of pesticide to be used as the treatment. 

3. Problem Definition :

A mechanism that required to detect and provide treatment to the disease to the infected crop and plant with the proper knowledge of pesticides and fertilizers with the help of agriculture experts and well-known farmers. 

4.SIH Problem and description Problem Number : 

RK1129 Farmers can upload the photographs of disease affected plants/crops and solutions may be provided by experts/scientists linked to the app.
